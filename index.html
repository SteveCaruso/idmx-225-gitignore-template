            <h2> Hobbies </h2>

            <p>
                When I'm not working or learning, I love spending my free time engaging in activities that bring me joy and relaxation. One of my favorite pastimes is playing video games, as they challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills. I enjoy exploring different genres, from fast-paced action games to strategy-based puzzles, as each provides a unique way to engage my mind. Video games also offer an opportunity to connect with friends and share exciting experiences, whether we're competing or collaborating on a mission.
            </p>

            <p>
                Basketball is another passion of mine, offering a fun way to stay active and bond with friends. Whether it's a casual game at the park or shooting hoops alone basketball helps me clear my mind and stay physically fit. The sport has also taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, resilience, and focus—qualities that I apply to other aspects of my life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I also enjoy riding my bike through the scenic routes near my home, as it helps me disconnect and recharge. There's something incredibly refreshing about feeling the wind on my face and taking in the natural beauty around me. On longer rides, I often discover new areas, making each outing a mini-adventure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tinkering with technology is another favorite activity of mine. Whether it's building small gadgets, experimenting with software tools, or troubleshooting tech issues, I find immense satisfaction in solving problems and understanding how things work. It's a creative outlet that fuels my curiosity and supports my passion for learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, trying out new foods and cuisines is an adventure I always look forward to, blending my love for travel and culinary exploration. Whether it's discovering a hidden gem in my neighborhood or experimenting with recipes at home, exploring flavors from around the world brings excitement and joy to my daily life. These hobbies not only keep me balanced but also inspire me to approach life with curiosity and enthusiasm.

            <h2>Understanding CSS Animation</h2>

            <div>
    
                <p>CSS animations are a powerful tool that brings websites to life, allowing elements to transition seamlessly between states or move dynamically across a page. They enhance user experience by creating smooth, visually appealing effects without relying on JavaScript or external libraries. Animations are often used for hover effects, loading indicators, or storytelling on the web.</p>
                
                <p>Using the `@keyframes` rule, developers can define animation sequences that describe how elements change over time. CSS properties such as `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, and `animation-iteration-count` control the behavior of the animation. For example, a bounce effect can be created by animating the position of an element and modifying its scale.</p>
                
                <p>Below is an example demonstrating a simple bouncing ball animation. The ball moves up and down while scaling slightly to mimic the effect of squashing during impact:</p>
                <div class="animation-example">
                    <div class="bouncing-ball"></div>
                </div>
                
                <p>CSS animations are widely supported across modern browsers, making them a reliable choice for creating engaging interfaces. However, it is essential to use animations sparingly to avoid overwhelming users or degrading performance, especially on mobile devices.</p>
    
                <p>Resources:</p>
