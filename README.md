## Blog Article: Understanding CSS Animation
This project includes a detailed blog article about CSS animations, exploring their use cases, implementation, and practical examples. The article demonstrates how to create smooth animations using CSS properties such as `@keyframes`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function`. It also features a visual example of a bouncing ball animation, which showcases the capability of CSS to create dynamic effects without external libraries.

- **Accent Color**: #FDE74C (RGB: 253, 231, 76) - Highlights buttons, links, and headings.
- **Neutral Color**: #E5E9EC (RGB: 229, 233, 236) - For borders and subtle background contrasts.
