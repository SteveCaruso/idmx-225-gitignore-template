## Description

The "About Me" project is a personal website created to showcase a variety of elements that introduce me. The project showcases my web developerâ€™s skills, experiences, and personal interests, combining creative HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements to provide a visually appealing and engaging presentation. This project was built to reflect a professionalism and personality, integrating sections such as bio, hobbies, photo gallery, literature, and a contact form.

The website is structured to highlight a rich, personal narrative while demonstrating technical web development skills learned throughout various stages of the project. Some of the skills learned and applied include:

- **HTML**: Structuring a webpage using elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS**: Styling elements for a responsive, modern layout with attention to typography, spacing, and color theory. This includes applying external fonts, background colors, hover effects, and creating a grid layout for the contact form.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website is accessible on both mobile and desktop devices by utilizing media queries and flexible layouts.
- **Interactivity**: Including interactive elements such as navigation links that allow smooth scrolling, a responsive navigation bar, and a contact form that integrates with Netlify for backend functionality.

This project represents a personal space on the web, offering a window into my background, interests, and skills while also showcasing my web development capabilities.

## Color Scheme

The website employs a soft, pastel-based color scheme, designed to create a welcoming and modern feel. The colors used in the design are as follows:

- **Light Pink** (Background of the body)
  - Hex: `#FFB6C1`
  - RGB: `rgb(255, 182, 193)`

- **Pale Violet Red** (Navigation Bar, Hero Section, and Footer)
  - Hex: `#DB7093`
  - RGB: `rgb(219, 112, 147)`

- **Light Blue** (Borders, Buttons, and Input Elements)
  - Hex: `#ADD8E6`
  - RGB: `rgb(173, 216, 230)`

- **White** (Text and Background of certain sections)
  - Hex: `#FFFFFF`
  - RGB: `rgb(255, 255, 255)`

- **Black** (Text in the Literature Section)
  - Hex: `#000000`
  - RGB: `rgb(0, 0, 0)`

I have always wanted to use pink background for a website. Although it was hard trying to find contrasting colors to pink these colors work together to create a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing look, balancing soft pastels with darker tones for contrast where necessary.

## Navbar

The navbar is designed to be responsive, using flexbox to arrange the menu items on larger screens and a hamburger menu on smaller screens. 


### Features:
1. **Responsive Design:** On screens smaller than 768px, a hamburger menu appears, which toggles the visibility of the navigation links.
2. **Hamburger Menu:** The hamburger icon is styled with a simple Unicode character (`&#9776;`) and is displayed on smaller screens using CSS media queries.
3. **Smooth Toggle:** JavaScript is used to toggle the visibility of the navbar links when the hamburger menu is clicked.

This ensures that the navigation remains clean and functional across all screen sizes, enhancing the user experience on mobile devices.

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar on this website uses a flexible layout with links to various sections of the page. In the desktop view, the navbar items are displayed inline, while on smaller screens (mobile devices), a hamburger menu is implemented for better usability.

### Features
- **Desktop View**: The navbar links are displayed horizontally.
- **Mobile View**: When the screen width is less than 767px, a hamburger icon appears, which toggles the visibility of the navbar links.
- **Responsive Design**: The navbar automatically adjusts its layout to ensure optimal usability across all devices.

### Implementation
- HTML: The structure includes a `<nav>` with a logo and list of links.
- CSS: Media queries are used to switch between desktop and mobile views. The hamburger icon is styled with flexbox.
- JavaScript: A click event listener is added to the hamburger icon, toggling the navbar visibility on mobile devices.
