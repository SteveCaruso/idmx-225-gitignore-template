[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/18ed1883-1e02-46d3-bbe6-9480a26656b1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-npcha/deploys)

## Header (Navbar)

I learned how to create a responsive navigation bar using only CSS, which involved understanding how to structure the navigation links and make sure they adapt to different screen sizes. I also learned how to link each section of a webpage within the navbar and how to add a favicon to the website.


## Hero (Main)

In this section, I learned how to use the img element to embed images into a webpage. I also learned about p element for writing paragraphs and how to apply CSS classes to p elements to customize individual paragraphs separately.


## Bio (About Me)

This section taught me how to style headings individually. I learned how to adjust their sizes, fonts, and margins.


## Gallery (My Artwork)

In the Gallery section, I learned how to implement a grid layout using CSS grid which allows images to be organized. I also learned how to use the hover effect to create interactive visuals. I learned how to make a text pop-up from the bottom of an image, adding an engaging layer of interactivity. Moreover, I learned how to link sections within an icon.


## Lit (My Blog)

In this article section, I also learned about the hover effect, but this time using a flip effect which creates a cool 3D rotation, making the images appear to flip when hovered over. Plus, I learned how to style and layout text and images in a way that keeps the design organized, without being too overwhelming.


## Video (My Video)

Here, I learned how to embed YouTube videos using <iframe> tag and how to scale down videos using CSS to ensure they’re not too big.


## Contact (Contact Me)

This section taught me how to create a working contact form using Netlify to process submissions. I learned how to use form elements like form, legend, label, input, and textarea to collect information from visitors. I also learned how to use various input types and options to customize the form. 


## Footer

In the Footer section, I learned how to link websites within icons which is an efficient way to add external links to your page without using text.
