# Project Title

This is the About Me Web page dedicated to my artwork and myself. In this project, you can find different sections of my bio, gallery, and contact me form. There are images of my artwork that I created, and there are small bios of myself. The project is also a representation of my HTML and CSS skills. This project really highlights my new skills that I obtained by working with professors in IDMX class and outside class. You can clearly see lots of complicated designs that are made by me, and I am very happy to deliver this final project to the public.
